# ✨Web portfolio v2✨

This is my new portfolio! I played around with animations and different styles that I am used to, it was fun to experiment. I'm so happy with the end result! 

##  Inspo and tools
I followed a youtube tutorial on react scroll - [check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl54MJDR2p8&list=LL&index=2&t=12625s)

For the first time I tried [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) animations, it was easy and fun to use.
