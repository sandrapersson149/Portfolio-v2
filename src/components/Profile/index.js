        I recently started studying Front end development. But before I got where I am today I have tried a lot of other professions. A couple of years in the service industry, trying out different workplaces. And two years working at a digital printing company, which gave me a lot of workplace experience and an appreciation for design.

        In school I studied Media and Graphic design. I have always been interested in technology and design. So now a couple of years after graduating I decided to seek new opportunities. I chose Front end development because it sounded interesting and fun! I like that there is so much to learn and different paths to take with it.

        Now i'm on my way to my dream job/occupation and feel so excited for the future.
